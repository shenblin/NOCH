##  Contrastive Learning-based Nonlinear Optical Histopathology for Noninvasive Tissue Characterization

This project hosts the scripts for training and testing contrastive unregistered patchwise-learning translation (CUPT) network, as presented in our [Paper](assets/Manuscript.pdf).


## Introduction

Label-free nonlinear optical imaging modalities like multiphoton excited fluorescence, second harmonic generation, and stimulated Raman scattering microscopy show promise for high-resolution characterization of cancer morphology and heterogeneity without exogenous labels. However, interpreting these complex multidimensional datasets proves difficult. Here, we present nonlinear optical digital histopathology (NODH), integrating biophotonic nonlinear signals with a contrastive deep learning framework to generate diagnostic quality hematoxylin and eosin (H&E) slides comparable to conventional histopathology. A patch-wise contrastive training approach overcomes registration challenges between nonlinear optical and H&E images. We demonstrate NODH effectively transforms label-free nonlinear optical data from human brain and ovarian cancers into realistic virtual H&E slides closely paralleling standard histology. Quantitative analysis confirms NODH images accurately reproduce nuclear morphometric features across different cancer stages. Combining multimodal nonlinear signals also enhances diagnostic classification versus individual modalities. By generating rapid, non-destructive virtual histology directly from fresh tissues, NODH could help overcome current tradeoffs between imaging scalability, specificity, and histopathological interpretation. This platform may enable more accurate and multifaceted optical assessment of cancer morphology and heterogeneity at the microscopic scale.
