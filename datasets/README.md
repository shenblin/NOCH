# Data download guide

The data used for training and validation will be made publicly available later. These data were captured by our multiphoton microscope with two aligned scanners: galvo-resonant scanning for high-speed acquisition and dual-galvo scanning for high-quality imaging. The H&E data were captured by a wide-field microscope.
