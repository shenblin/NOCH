# Data download guide

The data for training and testing NODH in the paper can be downloaded from: https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.10020760

The MP data were captured by our multiphoton microscope with two aligned scanners: galvo-resonant scanning for high-speed acquisition and dual-galvo scanning for high-quality imaging. The H&E data were captured by a wide-field microscope.


After inference, stitch image tiles into origin size:
